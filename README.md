The KTX Library provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing collections â€“ groups of a variable number of items (possibly zero)
that share significance to the problem being solved and are operated upon commonly.

## Getting Started

`associateBy` is an operation allows associate the list items with the given key.

```Dart
final List<User> users = [
    User(id: 1, firstName: "Dmytro", lastName: "Glynskyi"),
    User(id: 2, firstName: "Vladimir", lastName: "Zelenskyi")
];
final Map<int, User> mappedUsers = users
    .associateBy((user) => user.id);
```
